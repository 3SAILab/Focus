PLACEHOLDER FILE - Replace with actual icon.png

This is a placeholder for the Linux icon file.

To create the actual icon.png file:

1. Create a high-resolution PNG image with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 512x512 or 1024x1024
   - Format: PNG with alpha channel (transparency)

2. Save as icon.png in this directory
3. Remove this placeholder file

Design tips for Linux icons:
- Use simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good visibility at small sizes
- High contrast works well
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
